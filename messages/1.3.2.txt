Changes: in 1.3.2:

 * When sending messages from input, the message can begin with @user, #channel or .group to skip channel/user/group selection

 * New message from input will have autofilled the last @user #channel or .group used
  (for quick chatting, if you want to keep replying from sublime while you see received messages in chrome notifications)
